### Template for implementing asynchronous computing framework into a finite difference solver
This repository contains the files $\texttt{timestepping.f90}$, $\texttt{schemes.f90}$ and $\texttt{communicate.f90}$.
This code is a demonstration of the communication-avoiding algorithm (CAA) as described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03027).
