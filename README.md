This repository contains the files $\texttt{timestepping.f90}$, $\texttt{schemes.f90}$ and $\texttt{communicate.f90}$.
This code is a template for implementing the communication-avoiding algorithm (CAA), as described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03027), into a general finite-difference based partial differential equation (PDE) solver.
